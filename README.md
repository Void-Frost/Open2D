# Open2D
Open-Source 2D framework for ROBLOX and ROBLOX Studio. Aimed at convience.
For a long time ROBLOX has notoriously lacked easy ways to develop 2D games. That's why 2D games are so rare. This project aims to make 2D developing a lot simpler, by developing an accessible backend for collisions, movement, and possibly even physics (we'll see.)
